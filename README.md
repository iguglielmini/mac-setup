# mac-setup

Opinionated and automated macOS development environment setup for backend and full-stack software engineers.

This project provides a reproducible and fast way to bootstrap a macOS machine for professional software development, focusing on productivity, performance and long-term maintainability.

It installs and configures essential tools commonly used in real-world projects, including:

- Homebrew
- Node.js (via NVM)
- Python (via pyenv)
- Java (via SDKMAN)
- Docker
- Databases and CLI utilities
- Developer tools and IDEs

The goal is to reduce setup time, avoid manual errors and ensure a consistent development environment across machines.

## Who is this for?

This setup is designed for software engineers who work with:

- Backend systems and APIs
- Microservices and containerized applications
- Java (Spring Boot / Quarkus)
- Python (FastAPI)
- Node.js (NestJS)
- Docker and CI/CD pipelines

It is especially useful for engineers who frequently switch machines, work on multiple projects or value automation and developer experience.

## Why this project exists

Setting up a development environment manually is time-consuming, error-prone and often undocumented.

This repository codifies years of day-to-day development experience into a single, repeatable setup script, allowing developers to go from a fresh macOS install to a production-ready environment in minutes.
